# Abstract
This paper provides a foundational introduction to Stochastic Gradient Descent, highlighting its distinctions from standard Gradient Descent. Furthermore, it explores key challenges and solutions associated with its implementation, culminating in a simulation within the context of a linear model.

# Introduction
Efficiency in terms of solving problems quickly and effectively is one of the most desirable properties of algorithms dealing with big data. To extract information from data, one must formulate the problem as a mathematical optimization task and select a method that is expected to provide an optimal solution. Common and simple models can utilize exact numerical solutions, such as the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method for linear regression. In some cases, estimators derived from these methods can be considered efficient. Mathematically, this implies that the variance of the estimator is minimal within a certain class of estimators. However, for large datasets, the OLS method is not deemed efficient due to computational limitations.

This paper discusses one of the oldest and most efficient optimization methods for big data and neural networks: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Since Herbert Robbins and Sutton Monro \cite{Herbert} introduced their seminal work "A Stochastic Approximation Method" in 1951, SGD has gained significant popularity. It has been empirically observed to perform remarkably well across a wide range of statistical models in machine learning. Nonetheless, several open research questions remain, such as the formal proof of certain properties of commonly applied SGD sub-methods. For instance, the convergence behavior of SGD is highly sensitive to its parameter settings, and determining optimal parameter values remains a challenge.

This article provides an applied introduction to SGD, concluding with an implementation and simulation of SGD in the context of a linear model.
